            <P>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. it is  a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment(for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</P>
            <p>JavaScript containsa standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,and Math, and a core set of languge elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of puroses by supplimenting it  with additional objects;for example:</p>
                 <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Documents Objects Model(DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation</li>
                 <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objets relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, Server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
